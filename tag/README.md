# This file will generate a page for each tag in your site.
# Place this in _plugins if you use custom plugins, or use the below method for GitHub Pages compatibility.

# For GitHub Pages compatibility, use the following method:
# Create a folder called 'tag' in your root directory, and inside it, create an index.md file for each tag you want to support.
# Example for 'admissions' and 'medschool':

# /tag/admissions.md
---
layout: tag
tag: admissions
permalink: /tag/admissions/
---

# /tag/medschool.md
---
layout: tag
tag: medschool
permalink: /tag/medschool/
---

# You can automate this by creating a script or manually adding a new .md file for each tag.
# The layout 'tag' will use tag.html to render the posts for that tag.
