excerpt: "Some thoughts:"
---  
As you may know, for a very long time I have maintained the belief that I have nothing new to bring to philosophy, absolutely nothing at all.


None of my ideas are new and none of my ideas are my own. They all come from far greater beings, with far more wisdom than myself.
It is also my firm belief that philosophy is complete.
As for those who claim to be pushing the boundaries of philosophy *"forwards and onwards"*, I deem them to be pitiful individuals, who *start* with untenable beliefs and work *backwards* to rationalise their self-deceit and guesswork - to salvage the comfort of their ignorance.


But even though I believe that I have no great wisdom to speak of that has not been spoken of before me, I have also come to recognise that philosophy is a path adorned with lies, traps, smooth talkers and all other manners of falsities.
To avoid the throes of darkness (as I believe I have done), is ***so*** difficult that I don't even know how to describe it.
In truth, one of my dearest and most deep-seated convictions, is that I have only done so by the grace of God alone. I can find no other explanation for how someone who once bore so much weakness, arrogance and emnity in his heart, with no particular intellectual gifts, has been able traverse the pitfalls and temptations of philosophy.
And so I write with the intention to guide people, just as I have been guided, to a sincere and lucid truth, of which there is no doubt in it - "لا ريب فيه¨


I must also confess that I am pleasantly surprised by how many people have requested that I write down my thoughts.
Unfortunately notebooks of unintelligeble scrawl that criss-cross between languages, themes and constant paradigm shifts in my world view, won't do anyone any good, so my plan for this **website** (no, I refuse to call it a blog, Im not sharing recipies for cookies or anything like that!), is to elucidate my position clearly, which I'll be honest, I know I'm really bad at doing ~~sometimes~~... ok fine, *most* of the time...

So here they are... or rather here they aren't, because A levels have guilt tripped me into revising some really riveting concepts - like quadrats. I just *love* quadrats... because who doesn't wake up with a burning desire to write a six marker on the biodiversity of grass in a field... 

So until I get around to writing something truly meaningful, to the aformentioned undertaking, this is all I have to offer...
