Oftentimes, I think most people percieve me to be quite misanthropic... and a bit crazy... so I'm surprised by how many people have asked me to write down my thoughts.
Unfortunately notebooks of unintelligeble scrawl that criss-cross between languages, themes and changes in my world view won't do anyone any good, so my plan for this **website** (no, I refuse to call it a blog, Im not sharing recipies for cookies or anything like that!), is to elucidate what I actually think, which I'll be honest, I know I'm really bad at explaining *some*times... ok fine, *most* of the time...
So here they are... or rather here they aren't, because A levels have guilt tripped me into doing revising some really riveting concepts - like quadrats. I just *love* quadrats... because who doesn't wake up with a burning desire to write a six marker on the biodiversity of grass in a field...
