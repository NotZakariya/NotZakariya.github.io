# False Florin
*Forsake thine golden idol:*\
*The coveted coin that turns both sheep and lambs from the true way.*\
*For of the shepherd it has made a wolf,*\
*And of his flock, obedience to a mortal “salvation”.*\


*How woefully blind they must seem to the traveller:*\
*Bound in rapture by woollen fetters and boasting self-made chains with souls that sag-*\
*-Full of Pride, Envy and Avarice:*\
*Three burning coals that have set all hearts on fire.*\


*To Dante, that raging fire lay buried deep beneath the Earth - A thought that offered fleeting repose to the sinner.*\
*But now great cities also burn like torches,*\
*Fed by mountains of paper bills that ignite their masters’ hearts with unquenchable desire.*\
*To the sheep, the grand lustre of false florin flickers irrisistably against those passionate flames of mortal trinity:*\
*Three smouldering coals that have set all hearts on fire.*\
*Beneath their obfuscating smoke, seeing Inferno for Empyrean.*\


*Yet I hear no chirp of dawn chorus, I know only of its fabled song that wakes men from delusion.*\
*Shut out to lend our ears to a more pleasing euphony?*\
*Or drowned out by a choir in a song of black flame,*\
*Reaching crescendo on an anthem: Ode To Coin.*\


*If music be the food of love, of hate, of joy, of sorrow, of great opposites and dualities,*\
*If its coloured words may bleach men’s eyes black and white,*\
*Then play no more.*\
*If songs of passion can raze great truths and raise yet greater legends,*\
*Perhaps only the sober elegy, the calming of the senses, can cool blinding zeal.*\


*To look modern man cold in the eye and speak plain:*\
*Memento Mori*\
*Perhaps, those two words might cause him to shudder,*\
*To loosen his tight grip on that bottomless chalice - desire for mortal fulfilment.*\
*For what adequate response is there to the fact of our finitude?*\
*In those two plain words lies no firewood, no fuel, no rhetoric to ignite another flame,*\
*Just plain Truth.*\


*And in remembering man’s great blessing: giver of purpose, form and dignity,*\
*Do we dare to draw back that most theatrical curtain:*\
*To unmask the hedonic lie - robed in desire, honour and comfort.*\
*If man is truly king and God is truly dead, then purpose should not sit so heavy on the tongue.*\
*If men have died for greater ends: in the name of peace, justice and liberty, in the name of God,*\
*Then no, money is no great measure, pleasure is no great purpose.*\
*Both false ends.*\
*But I shall take neither false penny nor false florin for this thought.*
