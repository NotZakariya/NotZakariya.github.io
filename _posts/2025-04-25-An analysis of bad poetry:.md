Recently, I came across this piece which I'd written a few years ago. I think it serves as a perfect example 
A few years ago, I wrote this piece, which I have found. I think it serves as a testament to what one ought **not** to do when writing

*Through shattered glasses, patchwork eyes,*\
*I try to reason, fail to surmise,*\
*How the flame of freedom, the zealous cries,*\
*Burnt black with fervour, coddled lies.*

*A torch of justice, strife and right:*\
*All will shine in blessed whiteâ€”*\
*All were burnt by blood-borne blight.*\
*Snuffed out candles. Stamped out lights.*

*Chained in charred wicks amongst lucent walls:*\
*To the right cowers reason, with his senseless squalls.*\
*To the left lies honour, now the villain's thrall.*\
*Leaving me: freedom in cuffs, binds and all.*

*With a last crying breath, strangled by the hypocritic oath.*\
*Out dies reason.*\
*Out dies honour.*\
*Only silence pervades through the gloom of neglect.*

*But now I feel around for icy igneous bars,*\
*Squinting through an ashen light that takes the city captive.*\
*And I recognise those same nostalgic fires of frivolous bunting,*\
*Now carving locked legacies into young dim faces,*\
*Who befriend guns for toys, flesh for food-*\
*The patriotic fight becomes love.*

*The demon deified, the inferno we bred:*\
*Wartime ideology - the insurrection that bled.*
