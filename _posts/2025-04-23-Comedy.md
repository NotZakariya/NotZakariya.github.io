Humour is a quintessential human emotion. We laugh a lot.
Have you ever wondered - ***What is comedy?***


A sense of humour is undoubtedly a quintessential part 


> **Comedy** is the tension in pointless contradictions.
Let me explain.\
Imagine a man being circled by 10 very hungry lions. In a desperate last attempt to save himself, he stands on one leg, raises both his hands and pretends to be a cactus.\

Take the man who buries his head in the sand to escape the snapping jaws of a crocodile, or one who puts his fingers in his ears to hide from some unwelcome news.
The contradiction between the futility of their actions, and the wish to absolve themselves of their problems, gives rise to a meaningless irony:Whether these men hide or not, whether they run or not, whether they believe it or not, their problems still remain.
Nature is eternally indifferent to their whims.
It is this indifference that allows us to laugh off such meaningless acts as trivial - and thus comedy is born.
The crowd points and laugh at the fool, the curtain falls, and the masses disperse - 
Oblivious the the fact that they themselves are fools in an even grander and more comedic narrative.
Does the uncertainty of our future sit so heavy on the tongues, that men must always hide behind definites?
“I will go to that event”, “I shall see that film”, “When I get into university”
Does the mist of the unknown, and the humble relinquishment of certainty that it demands, trouble them so much, that men must fabricate such great lies of a promised tomorrow.
Do they not know that fate cares not for their whims and wishes?
“I don’t know” sits so heavy on the tongue - a second layer of irony.
And yet there exists a third - men also run away from that which is most certain of all!
Their words scatter like insects at the mere mention of “death”: that which is garunteed for every Lazarus and every Sisyphus.
Do they think that by burying their heads in the sand, they too will be freed from the promise of finality?
If one finds themselves inclined to finding the former situation as humorous, but finds the latter to be a grave matter, then hypocrisy is rife within the heart.
And so, the masses point and jeer at the cowards, oblivious to the fact that they themselves are fools in an even more comical story.
A borgouise play watched by a few sober onlookers, to whom the future is not that façade of certainty constructed by weaker wills.
As Nietzsche says “Madness is something rare in individuals, but in peoples, parties and ages, it is the rule”,
And so perhaps death defiance shall remain the rule of this mortal age, as it was for those that precedeeded it, and those yet to come.
But in quiet corners, remember that there exist a few sober onlookers who might yet whisper in your ear:“Come sleep and death, you promise nothing, you hold everything”,
Those who lay down their swords and walk forth, at peace, into the absurd.
