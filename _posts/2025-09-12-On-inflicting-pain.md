# Preamble
Before I begin, I must clarify that this is not a piece of **normative** psychology. As with all psychological inquiry, it would be arrogant of me to make sweeping conjectures about humanity as a whole, with neither empirical evidence nor conclusive life experience (as many overstepping philosophers have done before) - for I have glanced upon the chaotic dance of humanity for far too briefly to discern either pattern or form.

But, whilst I'm not qualified to describe the outwards, I feel that I have sufficient mastery of introspection to be able to analyse my own psychological state. And so this work, as with all my psychology pieces, will be elucidations of my own mind. You, dear reader, are at full liberty to agree or disagree as you please. I ask only that you give these ramblings their due - an open mind.

# The amorality of inflicting pain:
When I wonder why people cause pain, my mind immediately flicks to a long list of vices and psychological instabilities: apathetic greed, unfettered anger, sadism, masochism, insecurity - the list goes on and on... Intuitively, it seems pain is caused by evil, and so is itself a force for evil. Wherever these intuitions come from (whether they be biological predispositions or the result of environmental conditioning), it seems that the negative connotations of pain make absolute pacifism and nonviolence incredibly appealing prima facie. Which means talk of pain being "a tool" or "merely a means to an end" (like I am about to do), might seem jarring, sadistic, or crazy, to anyone who firmly believes in absolute pacifism and non-violence. So I shall take a brief moment to address pacifism before I move onto the main body of this work.
