# Preamble
Hello there 👋, I imagine the vast majority of people reading this article will have no interest in anything else on this website. At the time of writing, I intend for this to be my only article unrelated to philosophy, theology, politics or economics. I should also add that if you know me, or if you've ever read anything I've written, you know I have two very distinctive and polar opposite styles of writing. One which is incredibly formal and austere, and another which is much easier to read and much more comical. Don't worry I'm going to make this article the informal and easy to read kind, for the sake of making applying to medicine seem less scary and austere. 
 

There are 4 reasons for writing this piece on my experience of getting into medschool:  
The first is because if I write it up once, there will be less to explain to people who ask me in the future, and I think some people are scared of asking me too much.  
The second reason, is because without a point of reference, it's very easy to get lost and feel a deep sense of hopelessness, thankfully a few of my friends were in the same boat, so I didn't have that experience, but I know lots of people don't have that network of people with similar aspirations and experiences.  
Thirdly, I feel a bit bad that the only people who get my help are rich private school kids like me, in the years below. Don't get me wrong, they're super nice people, but I fear that the circulation of this kind of advice in rather elitist circles, just widens the privilege gap.  
Fourthly, and most importantly to me, I think this is a pretty good exercise in self-reflection, which will help me put this entire ordeal behind me (not that it was a particularly unpleasant experience, rather I like to index my thoughts and memories in my head if that makes sense? ik how odd that sounds, but contrary to what some people think, I'm not on the spectrum and I'm not a genius, I've just read a lot of philosophy)

I think I ought to also add a bit of context as to why this might be worth reading if you're applying to medicine. I got 5 offers from Cambridge medicine, Imperial medicine, UCL medicine, Manchester medicine and UCL philosophy, and got 3 A stars, and while that in no way shape or form defines me, it does legitimise my commentary on med school entry to a reader who doesn't know me.

So without further ado...

# When and why did I decide to do medicine?

To be honest I don't remember exactly when I decided I wanted to do medicine. I remember thinking in year 10 that I would 100% apply to Physics and Philosophy at Oxford at uni. I also remember my year 10 Chemistry teacher say "you've got bad hand writing, I bet you're going to be a doctor", to which I replied "pft, there's no way in a million years that I'd ever do for medicine, that's such a stereotypical brown person thing to do, because your parents force you to."

 If I had to sum up pre-med Zakariya in 2 words, they would be arrogant and naïve. I'd bought into this idea that society was continually moving forward for the better, that all the hundreds of generations before me were more stupid and backwards than me, that I could outdo and supersede all the stupid philosophers before me, and their backward ways, because I was just better 💀.

But at some point, between the end of year 10 and the start of year 11, my views changed:

![alt text](/images/2.png)
![alt text](/images/3.png)
(Yes. I blurred out reason 2, because it sounds stupid the way I wrote it, so it's philosophically embarrassing 🫠)

I won't explain what changed in too much detail. I could write multiple volumes on the many many many many changes in my outlook and personal philosophy between year 7 and now, but to put it simply, eventually I came to the realisation that I'm not that guy (or put less simply: I became disillusioned in enlightenment and hegelian ideas of human progress).

***Hi again... sorry to break the fourth wall...***   
*I started writing the next part... then 2 paragraphs in... I realised that I'd used lots of big words like "Cartesian skepticism" and "aristotelian virtue ethics"... so I deleted it..............*  
*Um... still not too sure how I explain why I wanted to apply for medicine without using philosophy (which is why I just lied in my interviews, and said some rubbish like "I like science and human interaction", it was just easier)...*  

*If you're really good at acting (I think I am), that's defo a strat btw...*  

I think the easiest way for me to explain my motivation for doing medicine, is to just spout aphorisms and hope you get what I mean.  
If not...   
Well... I tried to simplify the contents of hundreds of philosophical concepts in 3 quotes so give me some slack and just move on...  
Hey, it worked for Nietzsche in "Thus Spake Zarathustra" and Kierkegaard in "Either/Or", soooo maybe it will work for me too... 🤷‍♂️ : 


>***"The end of this science [ethics] is not knowledge but action" ~ Nicomacean Ethics***

>***"If God helf all truth enclosed in his right hand, and in his left hand the one and only ever-striving drive for truth, even with the corollary of erring forever and ever, and if he were to say to me: Choose! - I would humbly fall down to him at his left hand and say: Father, give! Pure truth is indeed only for you alone!" ~ Lessing***

>***"All power comes God, I agree; but so does every disease, and no one forbids us to summon a physician." ~ Rousseau***


If anyone reading this knows how long my quote list is, you know how hard it was for me to narrow that down to 3.
If it doesn't make sense to you, then just pretend you never read it I guess... Shout out to any Kierkegaard fans who thought the Lessing quote was beautiful by the way.


# How did I get into medicine?


**Before I begin, if you skipped all the way here, and your parents are forcing you to do med, and you're gonna just try and mindlessly emulate what I did, and you have no motivation for medicine... then... go away please 🙏 (that was my diplomatic way of saying the more... "colourful" words I would have said if this article wasn't public domain on the internet)**  

Go find some purpose in your life, hop off linkedin, hop off instagram reels, and hop off this article 07

Cool, that's sorted, and you're still here, so I'll be super naive and pretend if you're still reading, you're a really cool person who just wants to find their bearings, because they want to be a doctor to selflessly sacrifice their own wellbeing for the greater good of other people and society at large 🥰

I think the easiest way to do this is for me to give you my application on paper, then explain it.

# My grades:

I went to Haberdashers' Boys School, which is a pretty good private school just outside of London.  
I got these GCSE grades:
>English Language - 8  
>Chemistry - 9  
>Biology - 9  
>Physics - 9  
>Mathematics - 9  
>English Literature - 9  
>Computer Science - 9  
>Religious Studies - 9  
>Spanish - 9  

I got these A level grades for both my predicted grades and actual grades:
>Chemistry - A*  
>Biology - A*  
>Maths - A*  

I got a UCAT score of:
>3070

(to be honest, both getting an 8 in English Language and my UCAT score left me feeling pretty disappointed, but it just goes to show that you don't need to be perfect to get in.)

**By the way, these are my grades as a guy who goes to a prestigeous private school, if you go to a normal state school and you're reading this, while feeling like my grades are too high, remember that the grades you need for university are different based on whether you go to a school like mine or a school like yours. Universities account for this stuff and keep it in mind, so don't be disheartened!"**

# Do you need to do 4 a levels to get into Cambridge?

No.  
You don't.  

I did 4 a levels until 3/4 of the way through year 12 when dropped philosophy, because I personally felt like I wasn't learning anything new. I know lots of people might be thinking "am I at a disadvantage if I only do 3 a levels?", the answer to that seems to be no, in my experience. I have friends who did 4 a levels who didn't get into Cambridge, and I know people who did Biology, Chemistry and English Literature who did get into Cambridge.

# My personal statement:
From my reflections on philosophies I have studied and my work experience, I have come to understand doctors as professionals who use both science and empathy to empower people to live fulfilling lives. This alone is an inspirational ideal, but combined with the potential for lifelong learning and the opportunity to engage with people from different backgrounds in a way that few other disciplines offer, I cannot help but be drawn to a career in medicine.

While sitting in on a consultation, I was moved by the understanding with which a GP consoled a refugee with PTSD. Despite the language barrier, there was a deep sincerity to the conversation. When I returned to the practice as an employee, calling patients for long term condition reviews, I encountered a patient who only spoke Arabic and Spanish. As I spoke to him in English, he remained quiet and reserved, but upon using his mother tongue, he suddenly became talkative and grateful for the outreach. To me these two interactions symbolise the unique and rich diversity of the NHS’s patient demographic and I now understand communication and cultural awareness as essential to building a strong doctor-patient relationship, leading me to pursue learning Urdu, Punjabi, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese alongside my studies.

Both volunteering in a care home and a palliative care placement have taught me that medicine isn’t about saving lives, it’s about dignifying patients and improving their quality of life, by addressing their concerns. On my placement a consultant had difficulty gauging the prognosis of a deaf patient with dementia, because the team couldn’t communicate in BSL. It was only through speaking to his family and watching them sign to the patient, that the doctor was able to assess the severity of his cognitive decline. This taught me the necessity of the paradigm shift from paternalism to autonomous care. In the past the patient’s passivity might have been dismissed without querying his family’s concerns about his prognosis.

When I learned about outreach programmes to ethnic minority patients and listened to a BMJ Podcast interview on reforming the NHS, I decided to pursue an Extended Research Project on the defining tenets of a perfect medical system. Amongst other topics, I discussed the necessity of human interaction in medicine and the influence of different philosophies on GMC guidelines. As I researched medical history from Babylon to China, I came to the awe-inspiring realisation that the NHS is a culmination of 4 millennia of standardised medicine. Regularly reading the BMJ reminds me that even now healthcare is fluid and constantly evolving, as new research and policies come into practice.

Intrigued by an episode on the podcast Lab Notes about the difficulties of brain research and after seeing neurologists discuss the dilemma of further investigations, I wrote an article comparing various neural imaging techniques, which I then presented on after becoming Chairman of MedSoc. While researching these concepts, I was fascinated to learn about the recent shift from single-unit recording to Neuropixels probes. I am excited to see how our perception of the brain shifts with this technology and AI.

To relax I enjoy listening to philosophy and history podcasts. I run several clubs, including weekly debating sessions for younger pupils, teaching them to analyse problems and deliver convincing speeches, which I am excited to continue at university. From these rewarding experiences, I have learnt to sympathise with all sides of ethical issues without bias and manage my time to run these societies alongside my studies. For the last 3 years I have organised a student-run TEDx conference, which has involved extensive teamwork and outreach skills, entertaining speakers from North Korean defectors to CEOs.

I look forward to the scientific challenge of medicine and hope it will give me the empirical and emotional tools needed to empower and serve patients to the best of my ability.

# My Cambridge personal statement:

**you can write 2 personal statements for Cambridge, which no one told me about until they asked for it, the second one is much shorter**

I want to study medicine at Cambridge to become a doctor invested in the pinnacle of academia. Just recently, I was left awestruck as I read about the first complete map of the adult fly brain by Cambridge researchers and explored neural pathways in the open-source connectome. Treading this isthmus between knowledge and conjecture has always excited me: to understand how an electron passes through the angular node in a p-orbital, I borrowed my teacher’s university textbook to learn more. The more I read, the greater my capacity to reflect on research grows. Take a recent BMJ article suggesting NSAIDs disrupt tissue repair: considering the ubiquitous use of Ibuprofen, I think this research is more likely to impact the management of acute MSK injuries, than mark the end of NSAID use altogether.

So why Cambridge? I can’t help but draw similarities between supervisions and the Socratic dialogue. Both the prospect of furthering my knowledge with experts and the opportunity for multi-disciplinary intercalation excite me. I hope to gain a foundation in the medical sciences in years 1 and 2, before cultivating clinical skills and ultimately using a medical degree to give back to society.

# My Interview questions:

apparently I cant put that online 07




# What prep did I do?

**co-curricular**   
Some of the co-curricular stuff I did is already in my personal statement. There are a lot of other co-curricular things I achieved which I didn't bother putting in, my advice is only put relevant things to your course in. 
And I can tell you with absolute certainty, Cambridge ***DOES NOT CARE*** about DofE. (If you know the subtext to that, please don't reply to my linkedin post outing me 😭😭😭 )

**med reading**   
Because my mum is a doctor we get a copy of the BMJ regularly delivered to us. From year 12 until the end of my interviews in y13 I read the BMJ every week. Now a new issue of the BMJ releases every 2 weeks, so it should be much easier to read. 100% read it regularly if you have access, skim read all the boring research stuff like I did, it's fine. If you don't have access to the BMJ, try and get it off a doctor in your family or friends. If that doesn't work, try to get your school library to sign up for it. If that doesn't work, just listen to the BMJ podcast on spotify or wherever, that's pretty good too. If you can't do that (and you should be able to), at the very least just stay up to date on medical news through the BBC health section.

I also read a lot on neuroscience (which I've completely forgotten). I didn't get asked about anything related to my personal statement in any of my interviews, but the neuroscience I'd read came in clutch in my UCL interview where they asked about medical research I'd read about recently.

**med soc**   
If your school has a med soc, join it in year 11 ;).   
If they don't try to start one.  
If you can't do that, it isn't a big deal, I just name dropped I was "chairman of medsoc" once in my PS, so don't worry.  

**work experience**    
As you can see from my personal statement, I did... A LOT of work experience. In my opinon, what I did was overkill, here's what you need: 3 months of volunteering once a week (you need to be able to reflect on this), a week or a few days of shadowing a doctor (you need to be able to reflect on this too.)

If you want to be really techy, get some primary care work experience AND some secondary care work experience, so you can compare the two, but you don't need much, you just need to be able to reflect on it.

**Debating:**   

This needed its own special section.

It is incredibly easy to get into medicine if you do BP debating in school.

If you can do it, you should do it.

It makes interviews incredibly easy.

The disclaimer though, is don't sound like you're debating in your interview, use the same thought process, but frame it like a conversation NOT A DEBATE. 

I swear if anyone says "Panel, on side gov we believe that in the status quo" in their med interviews, I WILL COME FOR YOU!!!

# Closing thoughts

If I think of anything else, I'll add it. 

DM me suggestions and maybe I'll add a Q and A section at the bottom.

DM me questions too, my email is on the contact page, and you can use linkedin too, but add a message to your linkedin request to say you have something to ask, otherwise I'll ignore it if I don't know you.

Unless my SPAG actively hinders the readibility of this article severely, don't bother correcting me.   
Yeah... I know some of the people reading this will turn in their sleep over my SPAG,    
this aint a philosophy piece, this aint that serious, sorry buddy...

Oh damn, I should probably end on something that makes me sound approachable shouldn't I...

Ummmm, Im a nice guy trust....
