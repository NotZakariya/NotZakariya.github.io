title: "Thy venerable vulnerable heart"

*The knife that plunges deepest into the heart causes the most pain and damage, but also lets the most light shine in and lets the most darkness seep out.*\
*This state of agony, where thoughts flow freely in and out, this, dear reader, is called vulnerability.*\
*And in vulnerability, those jewels of the spirit - our convictions - are exposed to those that might snatch them away, and to those that might purify them.*\
*But just as one who has been stabbed rushes to cover their wound, the natural inclination of all men is to conceal their vulnerability.*\
*After all, hearts may bleed blood, but souls bleed a more valuable ichor - hope - and to lose one's hope is certainly a terrifying thing!*\
*But fret not dear reader, do not fear this state of vulnerability! For while a few specs of blood wonâ€™t avail a dying heart as it bleeds out, so long as a mere drop of hope remains to wet the soul, it may still beat on.*
