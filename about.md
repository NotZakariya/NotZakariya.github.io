# A Word of Caution:

*My hesitance to write speaks volumes.*  \
*To commit thoughts to words is to reduce them to this fettered form.*  \
*Perhaps I merely fail to express them, perhaps they are simply ineffable.*  \
*In balancing accuracy with clarity, I fear my work shall become another Tractatus:*  \
*So, I shall borrow its words of caution:*
