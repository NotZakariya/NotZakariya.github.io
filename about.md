<b><u>A Word of Caution:</u></b>
<br /> <br />
<i> My hesitance to write speaks volumes.<br />
To commit thoughts to words is to reduce them to this fettered form.<br />
Perhaps I merely fail to express them, perhaps they are simply ineffable.<br />
In balancing accuracy with clarity, I fear my work shall become another Tractatus:<br />
So, I shall borrow its words of caution:<br />
“My work consists of two parts, the one presented here plus all that I have not written. And it is precisely this second part that is the important point… I’ve managed in my book to put everything firmly into place by being silent about it” ~ Wittgenstein</i>
